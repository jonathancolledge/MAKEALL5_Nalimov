# MAKEALL5_Nalimov
A batch file to make all 5 man tablebases using the Nalimov tbgen. You will need to have made the 3 and 4 man tablebases already by getting tbgen (available here: You can get tbgen (64 bit version) here: http://rybkaforum.net/cgi-bin/rybkaforum/topic_show.pl?tid=24196) and running:</br>
tbgen -m 20000 -p kpkp kppk </br>
Assuming you have 20 Gb of RAM, you can change that, it is surely overkill. The original documentation says 10 i.e. 10 mb!</br>
You then put the batch file in the same folder as tbgen and run it. It'll take a day or more.
